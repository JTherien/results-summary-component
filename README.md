## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned quite a bit from this exercise. I learned how to use the fr unit which helped
a ton with sub-dividing the spaces. I also learned about the @media rule which I used to 
help convert the page to a mobile-friendly view. Lastly, I learned how to use JavaScript dynamically
change HTML content.

### Continued development

I feel that my CSS organization has gotten a bit better compared to the first but I think there's still more to do in order to keep
my code clean. I'd like to further my understanding of building a "mobile first" workflow. I also want to build out my JavaScript skills to be able to make more dynamic content.
